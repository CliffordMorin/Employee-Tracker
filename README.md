## Description

  Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. Often these interfaces are known as **C**ontent **M**anagement **S**ystems. In this project, I architected and built a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, console.table and MySQL.

  Functions in this application include:
  * View all Employees, Roles, or Departments
  * Search for Employees by Manager
  * Update Employees Roles or Manager
  * Add Employee, Role, or Department
  * Remove Employee, Role, or Department
  * View Department's total utilized budget

    ```
    As a business owner
    I want to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
    So that I can organize and plan my business
    ```

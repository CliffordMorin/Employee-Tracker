## Description

  Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. Often these interfaces are known as **C**ontent **M**anagement **S**ystems. In this project, I architect and built a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.
